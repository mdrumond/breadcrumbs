# Task 7: Final Polish, CI Hardening, and Release Prep

## Objective
Finalize the project with comprehensive documentation, automated quality gates, and release assets ready for publication.

## Scope
- Complete README, CONTRIBUTING, and CHANGELOG with setup instructions, architecture overview, and release notes.
- Harden CI to run build, lint, unit, and integration test suites across target platforms; ensure artifacts (coverage, reports) are uploaded.
- Add sample workspace demonstrating `.breadcrumbs/` usage along with screenshot assets referenced in docs.
- Prepare VS Code marketplace packaging (icon, gallery metadata, `vsce` configuration) and ensure versioning strategy is documented.
- Verify repository satisfies acceptance checklist items from `.codex/overview.md` and document how each is met.

## Required Tests
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run build`
- CI workflow run via `gh workflow run` or equivalent dry run demonstrating cross-platform success.

## Required Examples
- Provide finalized example notes, chains, and validation reports under `.breadcrumbs/examples/` plus documentation snippets showcasing end-to-end flows.
